"""xG prediction model package.

This package contains utilities for building an expected-goals (xG) model
from data collection through feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, and
visualization. Import the submodules you need directly from `src`.

Example:
	from src import feature_engineering
	from src import models

This file intentionally keeps exports minimal; use explicit imports from
submodules in application code for clarity.
